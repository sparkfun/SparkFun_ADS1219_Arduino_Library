This is an Arduino Library for the ADS1219 24-bit 4-channel ADC from TI. It allows you to fully configure the ADC.
Examples are provided to show how to use: single-shot vs. continuous mode; the input multiplexer; gain;
different sample rates; and alternate I2C addresses. You can read the ADC voltage in millivolts (compensated for gain)
or as the raw signed value.

Note: this library needs the [SparkFun Toolkit](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Toolkit).
